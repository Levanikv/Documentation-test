# Introduction

Naming is a crucial aspect of Design Systems (DS), since so much of a DS efficiency relies on having a shared language between different experties. Components names need to be short and clear: users new to Welcome need to at least have an idea of what they are for at first glance.

Usually, but not always, names will follow this rule of thumb:

- Atoms and molecules have context&hyphen;agnostic names (e.g. Button, Tabs, etc.)

- Bigger elements (Organisms, Patterns or even Sections) can be named after their function.

# Instantly understandable

## Use standards

✅ Input Text, Use industry standards: Input is an HTML element.

🚫 Text Field, Don't use vague or uncommon names, especially when industry standards exist.  
  


## Stay inclusive

  
![✅ Billboard](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/9e3167d9-d383-47bf-b69e-19a8cf2971b5.png)  
✅ Billboard, Billboard is common English word, generic enough to be understood (and cover several use cases).  
  
![🚫 Promotion](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/d366b466-daa0-4e2d-9b81-fba9b1b9fe1c.png)  
🚫 Promotion, Promotion (to describe special offers or highlights) is a French use of the word. Try and use business English.  
  


# Meaningful

## Name after the function

  
![✅ Toggle](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/a752970a-523b-480a-98ac-3a6db5af68a3.png)

![🚫 Switch](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/64e97a21-7a0a-4f47-9529-7550c13f0284.png)  
🚫 Switch, Switch primarly refers to the appearance (a light switch), not the function of the component.  
  


## Avoid names based on looks

  
![✅ Breadcrumbs](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/a37f8ac0-bdf7-432c-93fa-30ef8eb1e2dc.png)

![🚫 Directory Tree](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/1bfab915-370b-47d5-af3f-27b1a0a51b50.png)  
🚫 Directory Tree, The tree form is not the only possible to show the nested structure of a site.  
  


## Don’t tie down to a single context

  
![✅ Rating](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/b1856800-f8df-4265-b225-ec8bb529bbf6.png)

![🚫 All Grade](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/9011ac82-2ad5-4a3d-96cd-4e7c1fc05825.png)  
🚫 All Grade, Naming the component after a single context limits its reusability.  
  


# Consistent

Once a convention has been adopted in Welcome, follow it in every new addition to stay clear and consistent. This applies to components with related functions, or components with nested elements (for instance, a group of certain item).

  
![✅ Input Currency](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/3c572a71-5474-4d58-8696-96f8f5a7b917.png)  
✅ Input Currency, Input Currency is an Input like any other, so it should be named accordingly.  
  
![🚫 Currency](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/161625/faef4f49-cb2d-4541-9b38-3f33eb63e93c.png)  
🚫 Currency, Avoiding the prefix "Input" makes for a shorter name, but doesn't show the relationship between all Inputs.
