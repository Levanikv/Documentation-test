# I want to use a component on an image.

Sometimes, you need to place a component on top of an image. To make this easier and ensure proper contrast, we recommend adding an `overlay&hyphen;low` Frame between the image and the content. Then, set the entire Frame to local dark mode.

In some cases, an **on&hyphen;image **variant of a component may be needed. If this variant doesn’t exist yet, please reach out to your DSM to discuss adding it.

# I need a new color, ramp, or theme.

We just set up a [method](https://www.notion.so/ModeOP-Cr-ation-d-un-th-me-de-marque-1d8badc8975180c3acb4dca38316593a?pvs=4) to build new themes or colors within each ramps. Please reach out a dsm that will help you out and cover your needs.

# I want to change the color of a component only.

Theming requirements in our Design System mean that once a component uses a token, that token cannot be changed to fit another brand or context. If the color used in a component doesn’t meet your needs, please consider the following:

- Can you adjust the primitive color behind the semantic token for your theme? Reach out to your DSM to discuss this, keeping in mind that changing a primitive color affects multiple contexts since color tokens are shared across components.

- If you need a specific color override, create a local component in your personal Figma library and inform your DSM. Be aware that this change will affect your Adapt & Create budget (less than 20% of the component used).

# Why do we limit the use of component tokens?

To keep the number of tokens manageable, we limit creating specific **component tokens**. However, if you encounter a situation where a component token is necessary, please reach out to your DSM or use the Design System request channel to discuss exceptions. Currently, only the [Button](#) use component tokens in order to give more freedom to each brand to customize this key component..

# What are the matches with the legacy colors?

Legacy colors (from before the 2024 revamp) aren’t documented in Supernova and will be phased out during 2025. You can find a [matching table](http://docs.google.com) on Notion to help with the transition.

Note that visual changes from legacy to the new colors are minimal since the migration mainly addresses technical aspects.
