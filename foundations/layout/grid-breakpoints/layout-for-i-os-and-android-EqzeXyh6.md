# Layout for iOS and Android

---

This section explains the layout guidelines for both iOS and Android platforms, covering screen sizes, grids, and spacing conventions to help you create consistent and responsive designs.

# **Screen sizes for iOS and Android**

Design with different screen sizes in mind to ensure your designs scale well and remain responsive. The Design System defines the following screen sizes:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Platform | **Screen Size (px)** | **Example Devices** |  
| **iOS** | 375px | iPhone 12, 13 |  
|  | 834px | iPad Air (Landscape) |  
|  | 1210px | iPad Pro 12.9” (Portrait) |  
| **Android** | 360px | Pixel 4a |  
|  | 1440px | Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra |  


**Note**: These sizes act as a baseline to scale components and preserve the design’s consistency across devices.

# **Grid system**

The grid system is essential for organizing layouts across various screen sizes and ensuring a consistent look and feel. Here is the recommended grid setup:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Platform | **Screen Size (px)** | **Columns** | **Gutter Width (px)** | **Margin (px)** |  
| **iOS** | 375px | 4 | 16 | 16 |  
|  | 834px | 6 | 20 | 20 |  
|  | 1210px | 12 | 20 | 20 |  
| **Android** | 360px | 4 | 16 | 16 |  
|  | 1440px | 12 | 24 | 24 |  


- **Columns**: Ensure flexible scaling based on screen width.

- **Gutter Width**: Allows for appropriate spacing between elements.

- **Margins**: Ensure content doesn’t touch the edges.

# Layout, Spacing, and Responsiveness 


Adopt the [8px spacing grid](#) across all designs to ensure a consistent rhythm and clear visual hierarchy. This applies to both iOS and Android:

-  **iOS**: Follow [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout), making sure to respect safe areas (like around the notch) and maintain consistent margins, gutters, and spacing.

- **Android**: Follow to [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/overview), focusing on fluid adaptation to different screen densities and resolutions.
