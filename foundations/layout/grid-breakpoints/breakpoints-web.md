# Breakpoints (Web)

---

Breakpoints are defined as specific screen width values at which the page layout adjusts to better fit the available space. While breakpoints are not variables themselves conceptually, variables are used to implement them in Figma.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Mobile | Tablet | Desktop (Small) | Desktop (Medium) | Desktop (Large) | Desktop (Extra Large) |  
| 320 &hyphen; 767px | 768 &hyphen; 1023px | 1024 &hyphen; 1279px | 1280 &hyphen; 1439px | 1440 &hyphen; 1919px | >1920px |  


> Be warned:  
> Because the Grid of all breakpoints over Desktop (Medium) has a similar layout, with only margins changing, you can use it if you want to display your page at any given screen size superior to 1439px.
