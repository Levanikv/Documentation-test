In the design of app interfaces, it is essential to maintain a clean, organized layout by carefully managing the spacing between sections and using dividers. 

# Content section

The content section serves as the main container for all primary, secondary, and tertiary sections. It controls the vertical spacing between sections and helps keep the layout visually balanced across different devices.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| **Device/Screen size** | **Top space** | **Bottom space** |  
| **iOS (375px), Android (360px)** | 16px | 40px |  
| **iOS (834px, 1210px)** | 20px | 56px |  
| **Android (1440px)** | 24px | 56px |

# **Space between sections**

Within the content section, you’ll find three types of sections — primary, secondary, and tertiary — each with its own specific spacing rules:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| **Section type** | **Spacing (px)** | **Dividers** |  
| **Primary** | 32px | Optional |  
| **Secondary** | 24px | Optional |  
| **Tertiary** | 16px | Avoid |

**Primary sections:**

- **Spacing**: Each primary section should have **32px** of vertical space between them to separate large, distinct content areas.

- **Dividers**: Using a divider between primary sections is **optional**. It can help emphasize separation when needed.

**Secondary sections:**

- **Spacing**: Use **24px** of space between secondary sections within the content area to reflect a closer relationship between these blocks.

- **Dividers**: Like primary sections, dividers between secondary sections are **optional**. Use them to create stronger visual separation, but avoid overwhelming the design.

**Tertiary sections:**

- **Spacing**: Apply **16px** spacing between tertiary sections. These smaller, denser content blocks benefit from tighter spacing to maintain visual unity.

- **Dividers**: **Avoid** using dividers in tertiary sections to allow smooth content flow.

> Be warned:  
> **Use dividers thoughtfully**
Overusing dividers can clutter the design. Use them only when they enhance the overall layout.
