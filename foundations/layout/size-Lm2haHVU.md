# Size

Physical dimensions of elements in Welcome

---

Only a few elements in Welcome have a fixed size. This means they don’t use space but instead dynamically adjust their size based on their content, using flexbox in CSS or Auto Layout in Figma.

# Icons

Icons are vector graphics with predefined sizes that follow the 8px grid.
