# **Font icons usage**

Icons play a crucial role in navigation and communication within apps, and both platforms use dedicated font icon systems:

- **iOS font icons**: iOS uses **SF Symbols**, a set of over 3,000 configurable symbols integrated seamlessly with SF Pro text. They scale with text and adjust for accessibility needs. [Download SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)

- **Android font icons**: Android uses **Material Symbols & Icons**, providing a comprehensive set of icons aligned with the Material Design system. These icons adapt to different screen sizes and device densities. [Download Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/)

> Some extra info:  
> Icons should always align with text in terms of size and spacing, ensuring visual harmony and consistency across app screens. These font icons should follow the same typography spacing rules as mentioned above.
