# Baseline

The atomic value that defines all measurements in Welcome system.

---

Every element, from the smallest icon to the largest component, aligns with the 4px baseline.

Baseline  


This means that, as much as possible, every element in the Design System should have measurements (size, spacing, line&hyphen;height, etc.) that are multiples of 4px.

> Be warned:  
> Some elements, such as text size and line&hyphen;height, may not always follow this rule.

To maintain consistency, always use [numbers](#) as primitives when creating variables. These numbers, except for some text&hyphen;related values, follow the 4px baseline and the 8px grid for larger values (20px and above).
