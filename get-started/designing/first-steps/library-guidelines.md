# Library guidelines

---

With so many Figma files, it can be tricky to know where to look or contribute. Think of the different libraries as levels — the higher the level, the more people use and share their contents. Currently, we define distinguish 4 levels of “maturity”.

# Web

- **Individual libraries **(level 1) are used individually by designers. They often contain “comfort” components — elements useful for recurring content but less formalized.

- [**Local libraries**](../local-libraries/overview.md)** **(level2) contains elements shared by multiple journeys and/or designers in each Tribe.

- **[Candidate libraries](https://www.figma.com/design/X9PprfpQjNtwwdCPHmsgIP/%F0%9F%A7%A9-Candidate?node-id=5-6008&t=nhvkRdSD5IOwjg7l-11)**** **(level 3) holds components that meet the [inclusion criteria](../../contributing/contribution-model/presentation.md). They stay there until they fully pass the criteria; if not, they return to local libraries after a few months.

- **Welcome libraries **(level 4)** **contains components and elements shared across multiple squads or tribes that pass all criteria.

# Apps

Similar to the Web, App libraries are organized into different levels, with some key differences:

- **Individual libraries** (level 1)** **are used for specific recurring needs, much like on the web.

- **[Local libraries](../local-libraries/overview.md)** (level 2)** **are shared within the same team but not intended to become Core Components.

- **Reusable libraries **(level 3) contains complex components that don’t qualify as Core Components.** **Unlike the web, there is no Candidate library here. 

- **Welcome libraries** (level 4)** **contain atomic or MVP components that meet [inclusion criteria](../../contributing/contribution-model/presentation.md) to ensure consistency and reusability across apps.
