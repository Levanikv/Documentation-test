# Do I have to use a local library?

Using local libraries is recommended but not mandatory. As the Design System team, we believe there are benefits in shared components — like saved time and consistency — but ultimately, your team decides the best way to work.

# Why not move all components to Core?

Local components tend to be more volatile than Core components because they’re closely tied to specific contexts. They might change frequently — e.g., during an A/B test, special offers, or new product launches.

To avoid having to constantly update these components, we use local libraries—a level closer to you as designers, where you can make changes without needing DSM involvement, and that better suits your team’s needs.

# Can a local component ever end up in Candidate or Core levels?

Due to their specific nature, local components usually don’t become Core components — that’s why they belong at the local level.

However, local components can inspire other designers to use them in broader scopes. When this happens, DSMs help make these components agnostic and stable enough to be included in the Core library.
