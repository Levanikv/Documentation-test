# Overview

Welcome is an open Design System (DS), welcoming contributions from its users — Product Designers and Developers alike. Contributing means suggesting updates or additions through a process explained in this section.

## Types of contribution

Contributions come in two modes: updating existing assets or adding new ones. They can include:

- Contributing to **Assets **such as Icons, Illustrations, and Logos.

- Contributing to **Tokens**, like Colors, Space, and Typography.

- Contributing to **Components **or **Patterns**.

## Workflow

Contributions often start with design teams, beginning from the first idea by a Product Designer, all the way to release.

# Inclusion criteria

To include a contribution in the Core libraries, it must meet **5 clear inclusion criteria**. Assets are evaluated case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case.

Criteria  


> Some extra info:  
> For Assets, inclusion will be evaluated on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis.

If a submission doesn’t meet all criteria, alternative options exist:

- Components or patterns that aren’t reusable belong in personal designer libraries.

- Components that lack stability or agnosticism can live in the appropriate [local library](#).

- Overly complex proposals may fit into the [Patterns](../../../web/core-patterns/overview.md) library, which has looser criteria as its elements are less strictly managed.

- Components that are simple, common, and agnostic but not yet stable or reusable — yet likely to become so — go to the [Candidate library](./presentation.md). 

# Candidate library

This library acts as the “antechamber” to the Core. Designers submit ideas here, and Design System Managers (DSMs) review and assess their potential for Core inclusion. Contributions remain in the Candidate library during review and implementation. If a contribution stays too long without progressing, it may be moved to a local library or deprecated.
