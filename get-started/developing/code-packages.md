# Code packages

Welcome is also a collection of code components, available on three platforms.

---

# Overview

Welcome ideally mirrors Figma with 3 different repositories of Components and Patterns — 4 if you count iOS and Android separately.

## vue.js

The vue.js repository is managed by the Core Team. Components here serve all non&hyphen;AEM web interfaces. Note that two versions currently coexist:

- [**vue.js 2**](https://uxdesign.front-tribe.aws.accor.com/?path=/story/5-others-storybook--page), which is being phased out.

- [**vue.js 3**](https://ads-components-dev.netlify.app/), which gets new components added every sprint.

## AEM

AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) is the CMS used to create pages for most of Accor’s public&hyphen;facing products (such as ALL.com, except for the Booking funnel, and most brands).

> Be warned:  
> Currently, there’s no showcase platform for AEM components. For questions, reach out to your Product Owner or DSM, or check the [Confluence documentation](https://accor-it.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ACE/pages/5187044020/Component).

## Apps

Packages for Android and iOS components are available. To learn more, reach out to the mobile teams or your DSM.

- iOS framework is **Swift UI**
